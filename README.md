## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
An app that I would like to build is a recipe application for family/local recipes. Although there are many recipes online already, I want an application that will store my own recipes and recipes that have been passed on for generations in my family. I want to include many features to make it easy to add the recipe, for example, the ability to read and store handwritten recipes. Additionally, I would love to add a social feature where you can send others requests to send you a recipe of something they made that you loved. I also want to include various languages in the application to allow recipes of various cultures to be stored.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It was interesting learning more about Switf, however since this assignment was really simple, I did not encounter any challenges.
